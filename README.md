# Scanner-and-Parser
This is a scanner and parser for a tiny language, it was a project in a Compilers course in my college.
It takes a code written in that tiny language and the parser get the tokens in this code, then the parser draw the syntax tree using these tokens and following the parsing rules.

The syntax and examples on the tiny language can be found here:

I'll add more examples about this language soon.

Note: In the project you will find a dll called "Data Structure", this is the one I used for drawing the syntax tree, but I included it as a dll as it was my friend's job, cause it was a team project not an individual one.
